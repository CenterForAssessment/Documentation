At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern and the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health
emergency for the United States. Although many continued to carry out their daily
lives without interruption, drastic changes began to occur including in Indiana
when Governor Eric Holcomb declared a [public health disaster emergency](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/20-02ExecutiveOrderDeclarationofPublicHealthEmergencyforCOVID-19FINAL.pdf)
on March 6, 2020. Executive orders followed from Governor Holcomb mandating that
all public and private schools close and cease in-person instruction
[temporarily](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf), and ultimately for the
[remainder of the 2019-2020 school year](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-16-Education.pdf).

The sudden onset of these changes presented school leaders and educators with
immediate challenges, and they quickly adapted operations to provide the services
upon which students and families relied and to deliver continued access to education.
Governor Holcomb [cancelled the administration of all statewide assessments](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf)
and the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) [requested and received a waiver](
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/indiana-essa-waiver-request.pdf;
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/used-essa-waiver-approval.pdf)
from the federal requirement to administer statewide assessments.

On June 11, 2020, Governor Holcomb announced that public and private schools were
[permitted to reopen on July 1, 2020](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-32-Stage-4.pdf)
to provide in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 school year. In collaboration
with other agencies, the IDOE published "Indiana’s Considerations for Learning and
Safe Schools" [(IN-CLASS)](https://www.doe.in.gov/covid-19) to provide guidance
for schools when navigating new protocols for re-opening and re-entry of school
buildings. Ultimately, the IN-CLASS guidance signaled to schools that a return to
in-person instruction did not equate to a return to "normal."

Indiana, like all states, is currently grappling with the challenge of evaluating
the academic impact that the pandemic has had, as well as how to make efficient,
targeted use of resources to ameliorate learning losses. After more than a year
of uncertainty and disruption that has been introduced into Indiana’s educational
systems due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we can begin to effectively assess the impact
on student learning and achievement using statewide achievement data. Educators,
parents, and leaders need good information to help them understand and support
efforts to promote student achievement. Indeed, in the best of circumstances the
key outcomes and implications of student achievement data are sometimes difficult
to identify, and we are far from the best of circumstances.  

Understanding impact is clearly a daunting but vital task. What is meant by the
term impact, and on who, what, and when? To be sure, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all
approach to understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning,
and no single study can characterize it comprehensively. Nevertheless, the Indiana
Department of Education has collected high quality assessment data that can be
used to support its efforts to understand student learning and achievement during
the pandemic to inform state and local response and recovery of learning.

##  Study Goals

The purpose of this study is to provide Indiana stakeholders with insights into
how student learning and achievement was impacted by the pandemic. It focuses on
quantifying change in student test participation, and academic achievement in terms
of both status and growth. This report, therefore, summarizes achievement status
and growth analyses (Betebenner et al. 2020) pursued towards those ends. Historical
Indiana Learning Evaluation and Readiness Network (ILEARN), WIDA ACCESS (WIDA)
and NWEA Measures of Academic Progress (MAP Growth) data was used to establish
"fair" achievement comparisons and to derive baseline student growth percentiles
(i.e., describing 2021 growth relative to 2019 norms). Data in English language
arts (ELA) and mathematics from ILEARN and MAP Growth and Overall English language
proficiency (ELP) from WIDA was used in these investigations.

Given the higher than usual variability of learning conditions in Indiana due to
the pandemic, this study focuses attention on both participation and
achievement/performance for,  

*	students, schools, and districts, by grade level
*	student groups, including race/ethnicity, economically disadvantaged, students
with disabilities, & English language learner, by grade level


##  Research Questions

This study addresses specific research questions in two main categories of impact:
changes in 1) participation and 2) performance as measured by both status and
growth metrics.

###  Participation Changes

Complete descriptions of changes in student enrollment and test participation in
2021 is foundationally important for accurately interpreting student performance
in terms of status, trend, and growth. Therefore, this study proposes an approach
to quantifying enrollment and test participation changes that responds to the
following questions:

*	Were the changes in enrollment by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021 larger
  than enrollment changes in prior 2-year increments?
  - How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
  - Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?
* Were the changes in test participation by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021
  larger than enrollment changes in prior 2-year increments?
  - How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
  - Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?


###  Performance Changes
The study of performance changes based on 2021 testing results will support an
understanding of the pandemic’s near-term impact on student achievement. The term
"impact" is often referenced broadly in educational settings and can, therefore,
be unclear and diffused over many subjects, levels, types, and timelines, making
it difficult to isolate the most important investigative or research questions to
pursue. In the case of measuring the impact of the pandemic, the universal nature
of the expected impact makes it impossible to compare students who have and have
not been impacted. Therefore, the only link between the pandemic (as the cause)
that impacts achievement (as the effect) is that it is an event that occurred
between 2019 and 2021. There could be many other intervening variables for which
simple comparisons have not accounted. Also, as addressed by evaluation of changes
in enrollment and participation, data completeness and the surrounding testing
and student conditions will also be important factors to consider in the
interpretation of changes in status, and growth at individual and aggregate levels.

Therefore, student performance that is not influenced by pandemic-related conditions
will need to be approximated using historical data, and the models used to evaluate
impact will need to account for missing data. We identify the following questions
as a means to guide our investigation of the pandemic’s impact on student achievement
in Indiana in a way that provides a clear and coherent characterization of changes
in performance status and growth:  

* To what extent did the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19
  impact student participation in achievement testing?
* To what extent did the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19
  impact student academic performance and learning outcomes?
  - What are the observed changes in student performance (based on achievement
    test scores and performance classifications) by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021)?
    * How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
    * Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?
      - Racial/ethnic subgroups
      - Special education status
      - English learner status
      - Poverty status
      - Type of community (urban, suburban, rural, etc)
      - Mode of instruction
      - School type? (Tpub, Cpub, Nonpub/choice)
  - What are the observed changes in student growth by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021?
    * How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
    * Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?
      - Racial/ethnic subgroups
      - Special education status
      - English learner status
      - Poverty status
      - Type of community (urban, suburban, rural, etc)
      - Mode of instruction
      - School type? (Tpub, Cpub, Nonpub/choice)
* What is the projected time for recovery of unfinished learning, overall, and
  by district, school, and student groups?


#  Summary of Results

##	Participation

Non-participation^[We assume that being in the data file without a scale score indicates non-participation. We did not have demographic variables for these non-participating students and where therefore only able to examine non-participation by grade, school and district.]
may jeopardize our ability to understand performance, either overall or for some
groups of students (e.g., by student demographic or gender groups, or by schools
or districts). The foundational value of evaluating and reporting participation
rates, then, is that we can provide direct information about who is included in
test score results and who is not. Knowing who the results describe and who they
do not describe, will help us interpret student achievement in terms of both status
and trend. Such information can then be used to accurately identify student learning
needs and successes, overall and at group levels, and to monitor progress in their
recovery of learning post-pandemic.

The overall participation rate in 2021 for the ILEARN assessment was 99.7% in ELA
and 99.6% in Mathematics. These participation rates mean that 1,271 students who
were eligible did not test in ELA out of 485,823 eligible students, and that 1,665
students who were eligible did not test in Mathematics out of 485,429 eligible
students.

The students who did not participate were more often in higher grades (e.g., in
ELA 349 non-participating students were in grade 8 compared to the 111 non-participating
students in grade). Also, students who did not participate were also more often
in lower achievement levels in 2019 than students who participated (e.g., in ELA
50.0% of the non-participating students were in the lowest achievement level,
Below Proficiency, in 2019 whereas 28.5% of participating students were classified
as Below Proficiency in 2019).

Non-participation also clustered within certain schools. In ELA out of the 1,799
schools, 447 schools had at least one student who did not test. A smaller number
of these schools accounted for the majority of the students who did not participate.
In ELA, 96 schools accounted for 58.7% of the non-participation. Similarly, for
Mathematics, 115 schools accounted for 62.0% of the non-participation. See Figures
1A and 2A for more detail.

One simple way to check whether non-participation could impact our overall
conclusions is by replacing the missing scale scores and achievement levels of
students who did not participate. We do so by substituting in the lowest and
highest observed scale scores and achievement levels for each non-participating
student, and then computing state-level mean scale scores and percent proficient
based on observed scores and proficiency classification, for 1) students present
in the data, 2) students who are present combined with those who are missing where
each missing student is assigned the lowest observed score and achievement level,
and 3) students who are present combined with those who are missing where each
missing student is assigned the highest observed score and achievement level.

At the state level, these substitutions resulted in differences in state-level
mean scale scores that ranged from approximately 0.5 to 2.0 scale score points
and percent proficient and above values that range from approximately 0.1% to 0.4%
(i.e., a quarter of a percent). These differences can be considered the maximum
differences that would have been noted if all missing students had participated
and scored at the highest and lowest observed among those who did test. This
represents the most conservative view of the possible effect of missing students.

At the school level, these same substitutions of extreme scores and achievement
levels result in changes in median scale scores ranging from approximately 3.4
to 6.4 scale score points and percent proficient and above values that range from
0.1% to 1.3%.
