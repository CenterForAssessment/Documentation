At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern and the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health
emergency for the United States. Although many continued to carry out their daily
lives without interruption, drastic changes began to occur including in Indiana
when Governor Eric Holcomb declared a [public health disaster emergency](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/20-02ExecutiveOrderDeclarationofPublicHealthEmergencyforCOVID-19FINAL.pdf)
on March 6, 2020. Executive orders followed from Governor Holcomb mandating that
all public and private schools close and cease in-person instruction
[temporarily](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf), and ultimately for the
[remainder of the 2019-2020 school year](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-16-Education.pdf).

The sudden onset of these changes presented school leaders and educators with
immediate challenges and they quickly adapted operations to provide the services
upon which students and families relied and to deliver continued access to education.
Governor Holcomb [cancelled the administration of all statewide assessments](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf)
and the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) [requested and received a waiver](
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/indiana-essa-waiver-request.pdf;
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/used-essa-waiver-approval.pdf)
from the federal requirement to administer statewide assessments.

On June 11, 2020, Governor Holcomb announced that public and private schools were
[permitted to reopen on July 1, 2020](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-32-Stage-4.pdf)
to provide in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 school year. In collaboration
with other agencies, the IDOE published "Indiana’s Considerations for Learning and
Safe Schools" [(IN-CLASS)](https://www.doe.in.gov/covid-19) to provide guidance
for schools when navigating new protocols for re-opening and re-entry of school
buildings. Ultimately, the IN-CLASS guidance signaled to schools that a return to
in-person instruction did not equate to a return to "normal".

PRM__state.name__PRM, like all states, is currently grappling with evaluating the
academic impact the pandemic has had, as well as how to make efficient, targeted
use of resources to resources to ameliorate learning loss. This report summarizes
achievement (status) and growth analyses [@sgp2020] pursued towards those ends. Historical
TXT__test.name.abv__TXT data was used to establish "fair" achievement comparisons
and to derive baseline student growth percentiles (i.e., describing 2021 growth
relative to 2019 norms). Data in TXT__test.subj__TXT was used in these investigations.

###  Research Questions

This paper examines the following questions in detail:

  A) To what extent did the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19
     impact student academic performance and learning outcomes?
      1. Who are the students considered in this research? (sample/comparison group)
      2. What was the experienced learning loss in English/language arts and mathematics
         for the student populations and communities in Indiana?
          - impact based on pre-covid school year to 20/21 school year
              *Formative (fall to fall; winter to winter; spring to spring)
              *Summative (2019 - 2021)
          - changes within 20/21 school year (fall to winter; winter to spring)
      3. What disparities in impact exist between student populations and communities in Indiana?
          a) Racial/ethnic subgroups
          b) Special education status
          c) English learner status
          d) Poverty status
          e) Type of community (urban, suburban, rural, etc)
          f) Mode of instruction
          g) School type? (Tpub, Cpub, Nonpub/choice)
  B) What is the anticipated recovery time associated with the academic impact
     experienced due to the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19?

###  Methods

  A) Indicate consultation w/ TAC
  B) How do we define "learning loss"?
  C) Methods used to identify/determine learning loss
      1. Status: status changes in proficiency
      2. Growth: Use of baseline growth norms to provide context/comparison to determine loss
      3. Note: provide explanation of how "apples to apples" comparison achieved to confirm reliability of findings
  D) Established "impact" statuses and definitions
      1. No impact
          a) explain how it’s determined that "no impact" applies
          b) Indicate estimated length of recovery time
      2. Minor impact
          a) explain how it’s determined that "minor impact" applies
          b) Indicate estimated length of recovery time
      3. Moderate impact
          a) explain how it’s determined that "moderate impact" applies
          b) Indicate estimated length of recovery time
      4. Significant impact
          a) explain how it’s determined that "significant impact" applies
          b) Indicate estimated length of recovery time

##  Preliminary Findings

Spoiler alert! Turd is IN the punchbowl...
