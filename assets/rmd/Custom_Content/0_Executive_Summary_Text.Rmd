At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern and the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health
emergency for the United States. Although many continued to carry out their daily
lives without interruption, drastic changes began to occur including in Indiana
when Governor Eric Holcomb declared a [public health disaster emergency](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/20-02ExecutiveOrderDeclarationofPublicHealthEmergencyforCOVID-19FINAL.pdf)
on March 6, 2020. Executive orders followed from Governor Holcomb mandating that
all public and private schools close and cease in-person instruction
[temporarily](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf), and ultimately for the
[remainder of the 2019-2020 school year](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-16-Education.pdf).

The sudden onset of these changes presented school leaders and educators with
immediate challenges, and they quickly adapted operations to provide the services
upon which students and families relied and to deliver continued access to education.
Governor Holcomb [cancelled the administration of all statewide assessments](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf)
and the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) [requested and received a waiver](
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/indiana-essa-waiver-request.pdf;
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/used-essa-waiver-approval.pdf)
from the federal requirement to administer statewide assessments.

On June 11, 2020, Governor Holcomb announced that public and private schools were
[permitted to reopen on July 1, 2020](https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-32-Stage-4.pdf)
to provide in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 school year. In collaboration
with other agencies, the IDOE published "Indiana’s Considerations for Learning and
Safe Schools" [(IN-CLASS)](https://www.doe.in.gov/covid-19) to provide guidance
for schools when navigating new protocols for re-opening and re-entry of school
buildings. Ultimately, the IN-CLASS guidance signaled to schools that a return to
in-person instruction did not equate to a return to "normal."

Indiana, like all states, is currently grappling with the challenge of evaluating
the academic impact that the pandemic has had, as well as how to make efficient,
targeted use of resources to ameliorate learning losses. After more than a year
of uncertainty and disruption that has been introduced into Indiana’s educational
systems due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we can begin to effectively assess the impact
on student learning and achievement using statewide assessment data. Educators,
parents, and leaders need good information to help them understand and support
efforts to promote student achievement. Indeed, in the best of circumstances the
key outcomes and implications of student assessment data are sometimes difficult
to identify, and we are far from the best of circumstances.

Understanding impact is clearly a daunting but vital task. What is meant by the
term impact, and on who, what, and when? To be sure, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all
approach to understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning,
and no single study can characterize it comprehensively. Nevertheless, the Indiana
Department of Education has collected high quality assessment data that can be
used to support its efforts to understand student learning and achievement during
the pandemic to inform state and local response and recovery of learning.

##  Study Goals and Data

The goal of this study is to provide Indiana stakeholders with actionable insights into
how students were impacted academically by the pandemic. Who was impacted? In what were they impacted,
and how much were they impacted.

Any discussion of academic impact implies a comparison to a situation where the cause of the impact is absent: Where would the student be academically
had the pandemic not occurred. The situation is analogous to what one encounters when driving through inclement weather like a blizzard. We can ask,
"Where would we be along our journey if the blizzard hadn't occurred?" and answer that question using assumptions about normal rates of driving
progress. We can do the same with academic impact using historical data on student progress.

Addressing who, in what and how much students were impacted academically requires data. This study quantifies change in student
academic performance in terms of both academic achievement and growth by using comprehensive current and
historical assessment data from three sources:

*    Indiana Learning Evaluation and Readiness Network (ILEARN) data in grades 3 to 8 in ELA and mathematics
*    WIDA ACCESS English Language Proficiency (ELP) data in grades K to 12
*    NWEA Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) interim assessments are administered three times a year (fall, winter, and spring) by a large number of schools and school corporations in Indiana. Data from Fall 2020 and Winter 2020-2021 in grades K to 10 in ELA and mathematics was made available for analyses.

With the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 and the disruption of normal schooling, the pandemic functioned as a headwind, presumably slowing the
academic progress of students beginning in March, 2020. Indiana's state assessment administration was also disrupted. Specifically, the
annually administered ILEARN assessment was cancelled in spring, 2020. Pandemic related analyses involving the ILEARN assessment
will necessarily have to utilize skip-year analyses, going back to 2019 as a pre-pandemic point of comparison.

Unlike the ILEARN assessment, the annually administered WIDA ACCESS ELP assessment was administered
in early 2020 prior to the onset of the pandemic. Analyses involving WIDA-ACCESS will utilize
2020 as the pre-pandemic point of comparison.

Interim assessment data comprised the first evidence received regarding the academic impact of the pandemic on students.
The most frequently used interim assessment in Indiana is the NWEA MAP assessment. Through data sharing agreements, the
Indiana Department of Education receives MAP data for all students in the state taking the assessments. Data for
Fall 2020 and Winter 2020-2021 was made available including student growth data based upon historical growth norms that can be used
to assess academic impact during the early part of the 2020-2021 academic year.

The availability of these three data sets places Indiana at the forefront of states nationally in using data to understand the academic impact of the
pandemic. Clearly, the three data sets do not cover all ages of students nor all subjects in which students learn.
However, they do support an essential first step in examining academic impact and discussing strategies for recovery that apply to all ages and
subjects.


#  Research Questions

This study addresses three research questions:

* __Student Population and Test Participation__ Who comprises the population of students in Indiana and who comprises the population for whom academic impact data is available?
* __Academic Impact__ To what extent did COVID-19 disruptions impact student academic performance and learning outcomes? What content areas/domains did students experience academic impacts. Which student demographic and academic subgroups, schools, and school corporations experience academic impacts.
* __Anticipated Recovery Time__ What is the anticipated academic recovery time based on the experienced COVID-19 disruptions?

## Student Population and Test Participation

Descriptions of changes in student enrollment and test participation in 2021 is important for accurately
interpreting student performance in terms of status, trend, and growth. Like most states, Indiana saw a drop in overall student enrollment
in 2021. Public school PK-12 enrollment in 2020 was 1,050,614. This compares to 1,054,903 students in 2019.

More significantly for the determination of academic impact is student participation as part of assessment data collection. Census level educational assessments like ILEARN and WIDA-ACCESS are critical for understanding the academic performance of students and, in turn, investigating the
academic impact that the pandemic has had on students. The two population level data sources used for this student (ILEARN and WIDA-ACCESS) both had
excellent participation in 2021, similar to participation in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

* ILEARN participation rates were 97% in ELA and 97% in mathematics.
* WIDA-ACCESS participation rates were 94%
* NWEA-MAP is the most used interim assessment in Indiana. Participation rates amongst students in Indiana vary by grade (K to 10) and content area (ELA and mathematics). In general, participation rates ranged between 35 and 45% except in grades 9 and 10 where participation dips to near 20%.

From a national perspective, the data available from Indiana's assessments is some of the most comprehensive available for the investigation of pandemic
related academic impact in a state.


## Academic Impact

The study of performance changes based on 2021 testing results will support an
understanding of the pandemic’s near-term impact on student achievement. The term
"impact" is often referenced broadly in educational settings and can, therefore,
be unclear and diffused over many subjects, levels, types, and timelines, making
it difficult to isolate the most important investigative or research questions to
pursue. In the case of measuring the impact of the pandemic, the universal nature
of the expected impact makes it impossible to compare students who have and have
not been impacted. Therefore, the only link between the pandemic (as the cause)
that impacts achievement (as the effect) is that it is an event that occurred
between 2019 and 2021. There could be many other intervening variables for which
simple comparisons have not accounted. Also, as addressed by evaluation of changes
in enrollment and participation, data completeness and the surrounding testing
and student conditions will also be important factors to consider in the
interpretation of changes in status and growth at individual and aggregate levels.

Therefore, student performance that is not influenced by pandemic-related conditions
will need to be approximated using historical data, and the models used to evaluate
impact will need to account for missing data. We identify the following questions
as a means to guide our investigation of the pandemic’s impact on student achievement
in Indiana in a way that provides a clear and coherent characterization of changes
in performance status and growth:

* To what extent did the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19 impact student participation in achievement testing?
* To what extent did the disruptions in educational programming due to COVID-19 impact student academic performance and learning outcomes?
  - What are the observed changes in student performance (based on achievement test scores and performance classifications) by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021)?
    * How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
    * Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?
      - Racial/ethnic subgroups
      - Special education status
      - English learner status
      - Poverty status
      - Type of community (urban, suburban, rural, etc.)
      - Mode of instruction
      - School type (Tpub, Cpub, Nonpub/choice)
  - What are the observed changes in student growth by grade and subject from 2019 to 2021?
    * How do these changes vary over students, student groups, schools, and districts?
    * Are larger changes associated with identifiable student groups, schools, or districts?
      - Racial/ethnic subgroups
      - Special education status
      - English learner status
      - Poverty status
      - Type of community (urban, suburban, rural, etc)
      - Mode of instruction
      - School type (Tpub, Cpub, Nonpub/choice)
* What is the projected time for recovery of unfinished learning, overall, and by district, school, and student groups?


#  Summary of Results

## Achievement

Pandemic related impact on academic achievement was investigated for two of the three data sources (ILEARN and WIDA-ACCESS).


### ILEARN achievement

Due to ILEARN's very high participation rates in 2021 and minimal enrollment shifts, we compare aggregate scores from 2019 and 2021 without making
any adjustments for non-participation. Comparison group level grade by content area results in 2021 to those in 2019 shows steep declines in the usually reported percent proficient. Similar declines are observed when looking at mean scale scores.

* Declines in percent proficient ranged from 7 to 9 percent in ELA and 9 to 14 percent in mathematics. For reference, historical year-over-year improvement in percent proficient in Indiana is usually between 1 and 2 percent
* Effect size declines in achievement were large, ranging between 0.2 and 0.4 depending upon grade and content area.

### WIDA-ACCESS achievement

To be added.



##  Growth

Pandemic related impact on academic growth was investigated for each of the three data sources using historical student growth data for each
of the three data sources. The extent to which student academic growth slowed down is an indication of the extent to which the
pandemic had on the students academically. The following growth data was utilized from each of the three data sources:

* NWEA Map growth data from Fall 2019 to Fall 2020, Winter 2019 to Winter 2020-2021, and Fall 2020 to Winter 2020-2021.
* WIDA-ACCESS growth data from 2020 to 2021 for Grades 1 to 12 in English language proficiency.
* ILEARN growth data from 2019 to 2021 (note: ILEARN was not administered in 2020) for Grades 5 to 8 in ELA and mathematics.

For each data source, historical growth norms (i.e., baseline SGPs) are utilized to determine the extent to which student learning
has slowed down during the pandemic. For ILEARN, 2019 was the pre-covid base year from which historical growth norms are created. For WIDA-ACCESS, 2020
was the pre-covid base year from which historical growth normed are derived. For NWEA-MAP, nationally representative, historical growth norms
currently employ data from 2019 (see [NWEA 2020 Map Growth technical report](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)).

For the historical growth norming population, the median SGP for the population is 50. Thus, in 2021, deviation (below) 50 is indicative of the extent
to which learning has been impeded by the pandemic.


### NWEA Map growth

Growth results from NWEA Map reflect student performance prior in the pandemic to both ILEARN and WIDA-ACCESS. Academic impact based upon NWEA results
suggests


### WIDA-ACCESS growth

WIDA-ACCESS growth indicates substantial academic impact for elementary school grades, moderate impact for middle school grades, and modest to no impact
for high school grades. Because academic impact involves comparisons to pre-pandemic performance, modest to no impact could either imply a student
group thriving during the pandemic (relative to most others who were impacted) or lackluster performance pre-pandemic.

* By grade, median baseline SGPs for ELA exhibited decreases by 10 and 19 point drop (from 50 in 2020).


### ILEARN growth

ILEARN growth indicates substantial academic impact due to the pandemic. In general, academic impacts in mathematics were larger than they were in ELA.

* By grade, median baseline SGPs for ELA exhibited between a 10 and 11 point drop (from 50 in 2019). In mathematics the decreases ranged between 19 and 22. Decreases in ELA are associated with medium effect sizes where as those in mathematics are large.
* By ethnicity decreases in median baseline SGPs for ELA were between 10 and 14. In mathematics the decreases ranged from 19 to 24.
* By free/reduced lunch status, decreases in median baseline SGPs for ELA were between 9 and 12. In mathematics the decreases ranged between 19 and 20.
* By special education status, decreases in median baseline SGPs for ELA were 11 points. In mathematics the decrease was 7 (going from 36 in 2019 to 29 in 2021). The modest decrease during the pandemic in mathematics seems to suggest that growth prior to the pandemic was rather weak so that pandemic disruptions did little to drive learning down less than it already is.
* By English learner status, decrease in baseline median student growth percentiles was 14. In mathematics the decrease was 19.
* By gender, the decrease for males in ELA and mathematics was 12 and 17, respectively. For females the decreases are 10 and 22.
* By mode of education (Hybrid, In-Person, Remote) the decreases in ELA were 8, 11, and 17, respectively. For mathematics the decreases were 23, 14, and 32, respectively.
* Students grouped by starting (i.e., 2019) scale score decile demonstrated differing levels of academic impact dependent upon grade and content area. In middle school mathematics, high achieving students demonstrated greater academic impact than lower achieving students.
* Schools and school corporations demonstrate highly varied levels of academic impact ranging from severe to no impact/improvement.


## Academic Recovery

Academic impact results consistently show moderate to severe impact. Characterization of impact as moderate, large, or severe derive both from effect
size calculations of what changes in performance historically look like as well as a decade of use of achievement and growth data as part of state accountability systems. The large effect sizes/low growth results associated with state level data are unprecedented. Deviations of this magnitude
are most frequently seen with underperforming schools, but never with entire states. To that end, recovery will almost certainly require efforts that
have not been employed previously.

Depending upon school and school corporation impact analyses, tailored solutions will be necessary to facilitate complete academic recovery.
