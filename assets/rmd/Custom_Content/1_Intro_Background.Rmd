# Background

At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern and the
United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health
emergency for the United States. The vast majority of Hoosiers throughout the
State of Indiana continued to carry out their daily lives without interruption
or interference from the global and national threat introduced by COVID-19 until
March 6, 2020, when Governor Eric Holcomb declared a public health disaster
emergency existed in Indiana that was attributable to COVID-19^[

Matters escalated as the number of positive COVID-19 cases rose exponentially
over the following days and weeks.  

On March 19, 2020, Governor Holcomb issued an executive order mandating that all
public and private schools serving students in kindergarten through grade 12 must
close and cease in-person instruction through May 1, 2020 in response to the rapid
spread of COVID-19 in Indiana^[https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf], and
ultimately required schools to close their buildings and provide remote instruction
to students for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year^[https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-16-Education.pdf].

The sudden onset of these changes during such unprecedented times brought about
many obstacles for the "K12" environment. School leaders and educators were faced
with immediate challenges as they quickly adapted operations to ensure students
were provided with services upon which students and families relied and to deliver
technology for continued access to educational services. Educators worked to revise
their curriculum and syllabi to adjust for new virtual instruction methods that
provided academic content and encouraged student engagement. To ensure the safety
and wellbeing of students and school staff, Governor Holcomb cancelled the
administration of all statewide assessments^[https://www.in.gov/gov/files/EO_20-05.pdf].
Additionally, the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) requested and received
from the US Department of Education a waiver from the federal requirement to
administer statewide assessments^[https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/indiana-essa-waiver-request.pdf;
https://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/essa/used-essa-waiver-approval.pdf].

On June 11, 2020, Governor Holcomb announced that public and private schools serving
students in kindergarten through grade 12 were permitted to reopen on July 1, 2020
to provide in-person instruction for students during the 2020-2021 school year^[
https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive-Order-20-32-Stage-4.pdf]. With the reinstatement
of in-person instruction came many operational considerations that schools had to
confront for the first time. The IDOE, in collaboration with the Indiana State
Department of Health and the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration,
published "Indiana’s Considerations for Learning and Safe Schools"^[https://www.doe.in.gov/covid-19]
(IN-CLASS) to provide guidance for schools when navigating new protocols for
re-opening of school buildings and re-entry of students and staff. Ultimately,
the IN-CLASS guidance signaled to schools that a return to in-person instruction
did not equate to a return to "normal".

The IN-CLASS guidance recommended that schools evaluate their local operations
based on the school’s ability to maintain a safe and healthy school environment,
and the prevalence of COVID-19 in their community at large. Given the uncertain
nature and evolution of COVID-19, the vast majority of public school corporations
and public charter schools opted to continue to use virtual instruction throughout
the 2020-2021 school year for COVID-related reasons.

While virtual instruction was provided during the 2020-2021 school year, it was
not the default mode of instruction for Indiana schools. (INSERT DATA ON MODE OF INSTRUCTION)
